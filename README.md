Working with CSS

Use CSS to change how this biography looks by changing the values of the properties I have used.

1. Make the level one heading pink, using the CSS color keyword hotpink.
2. Give the heading a 10px dotted border-bottom which uses the CSS color keyword purple.
3. Make the level 2 heading italic.
4. Give the ul used for the contact details a background-color of #eeeeee, and a 5px solid purple border. Use some padding to push the content away from the border.
5. Make the links green on hover.
